# Personal Homebrew Taps

This a [Homebrew Tap][] containing a collection of "formulae" that have not yet been accepted into the mainline [Homebrew repo][] or a different, more authoritative tap.

## Usage

First, add this tap to Homebrew.  This will clone the tap repository and symlink all of its formulae.

```bash
brew tap straxhaber/personal
```

Now you can work on those formulae as if they were in canonical Homebrew repository:

```bash
brew install cfenv
brew install cf-build
```
